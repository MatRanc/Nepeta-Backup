BUGS:

- Editing mode
- Corner clipping isn’t perfect
- Adding icons to folders in editing mode leads to a crash

OTHER WORK:

- Handle edge case icons when generating icon co-ordinates
? Handle edge cases when pinching to open
- Make rotation look nicer
- Allow user to have widgets “hover” (allows compatibility with stuff like GridLock)
- Finish up on Help UI
- Add “Setting up…” UI
- Rewrite pinch handling to use a UIWindow over icons; kills all pinch issues
- Add padlock image for iPad widget locking
- Check that passcode popover on iPad iOS 8 looks right
