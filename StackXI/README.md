Grouped notifications, iOS 12 style.

## Distribution

The license doesn't forbid you, but I'd be glad if you could message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/NepetaDev) before releasing anything based on this code.

## The bug

The issue is that you are not able to clear old notifications (the ones that go to sectionList instead of priorityList).
