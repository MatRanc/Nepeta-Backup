#### Pre-compiled debs
Pre-compiled debs are available via GitHub releases, if that is your fancy.

If you want to compile Zebra yourself, you can use the following steps. A computer running macOS is _required_ and must have Xcode installed.

1. Clone this repository using `git clone https://github.com/wstyres/Zebra.git`
2. Open the Zebra.xcodeproj and configure the signing identities so that it will compile properly
3. `cd` into the `Zebra` folder
4. run `make do`
   1. If you don't have `theos` already installed on your computer, follow the steps located [here](https://github.com/theos/theos/wiki/Installation).
5. Done!
